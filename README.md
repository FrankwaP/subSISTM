# subSISTM
Using Machine Learning approaches to better leverage longitudinal health studies data.


The purpose of this repository is (of ourse) to share our work, but also 
to standardize a bit our practices.

One practice that is encouraged is the use of notebooks, so at all point we can simply open our notebook 
or go to the Github page (which renders/displays them) to present the current state of our work:
 - data source
 - data vizualisation
 - model training
 - model evaluation

Jupyter are suggested as they work for **Ju**lia/**Pyt**hon/**R**.


**NOTE**: all "*_local" folders and "*_local.*" files will be considered asâ€¦ local, and will be ignored by git! (see .gitignore)
